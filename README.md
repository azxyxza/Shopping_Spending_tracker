# Shopping-Spending tracker (S-S)

## Shop smart, Spend wise!

### Designed by Xiaoyang Zhang 


This project aims to create a shopping-budget-tracker application for customer to use 
before, during, and after the shopping.

### What does the shopping tracker do
- **Before the shopping**
  - Check out what you have at "Home" with visualized dates (avoid wasting)
  - Categorize your home based on items' property (make your Home organized)
  - Add whatever you plan to buy to the shopping list
  - Set the budget for this shopping trip
  
- **During the shopping**
  - Cross the things off that have already added to the shopping cart
  
- **After the shopping**
  - Enter the expenses of the objects you bought and keep track in the "Spending" page
  - Visualize all your income, expenses, and balance

### Who will use it

-*For everyone who ...*
- want to be well-prepared before going into the supermarket
- is interested in keeping track the objects they have
- would like to keep track of the balance, manage and spend money wisely
- love life, pursue a healthy balance between goods and money

### My inspiration for this project

As an international student who lives alone on campus, I need to go shopping weekly to prepare for the food, necessities,
and anything I needed for the following week. Without a list, I always feel disoriented and overwhelmed by the dazzling 
shelves in the shopping market. Not only do I wasted a lot of time figuring out what I really need, but also wasted my 
money to buy many kinds of stuffs that I actually don't need. Sometimes I even repurchased or over purchase something 
that cause things to expire in my fridge later. Since my living expenses are limited, I realized the importance to have
an organized shopping list and learn to manage my money by keeping track of my balance. I can't imagine how helpful it 
would be for me and hopefully for many other people to have a tool that combines these two applications. Therefore, 
I want to create an intelligent tool that could bring efficiency and happiness to life, recognize and appreciate what we 
own, have a more pleasant shopping experience, and better managing our relationship with money.
