# Shopping tracker

## Be wise with shopping list and balance


This project aims to create a shopping-money-tracker application for customer to use before, during, and after the shopping.

**What does the shopping tracker do**
- *Before the shopping*
  - Set the expected spending for this shopping
  - Add whatever you plan to buy to the shopping list
  - You can also categorize the need to buy a thing including "Must", "May", "Can", "Based on mood"
- *During the shopping*
  - Cross the things off that have already added to the chart
- *After the shopping*
  - the purchased item will be added to the transaction page 
  - Enter the amount of money you spent on that object and load the expense to the spending page
  - The spending page will visualize all your balance and expenses

**Who will use it**
    *For everyone who is:*
- interested to keep their shopping list organized
- want to be well-prepared before going into the supermarket
- keep track of the balance and spend money wisely

**My inspiration for this project**

As an international student who live alone on campus, I need to go shopping weekly to prepare for the food, necessities, 
and anything I needed for the following week. Without a list, I feel disoriented and overwhelmed by the dazzling shelves.
Not only do I wasted a lot of time figuring out what I really want, but also wasted my money to buy many stuffs that I 
actually don't need. Since my living expenses is limited, I realized the importance of an organized shopping list and 
spending-tracking application. Therefore, I want to create this intelligent app that could bring efficiency and happiness
to life, better managing our relationship with shopping and money.
