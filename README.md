# Shopping tracker

## Shop smart, Spend wise!


This project aims to create a shopping-budget-tracker application for customer to use 
before, during, and after the shopping.

**What does the shopping tracker do**
- *Before the shopping*
  - Check out what you have in the "Fridge" (avoid wasting)
  - Categorize your fridge based on items' property (make your fridge organized)
  - Add whatever you plan to buy to the shopping list
  - Set the budget for this shopping 
- *During the shopping*
  - Cross the things off that have already added to the shopping cart
- *After the shopping*
  - the purchased item will be added to the "Fridge" page and "Transaction" page 
  - Enter the amount of money you spent on that object and keep track in the "Spending" page
  - The "Spending" page will visualize all your balance and expenses

**Who will use it**

*For everyone who ...*
- is interested in keep their shopping list organized
- want to be well-prepared before going into the supermarket
- would like to keep track of the balance, manage and spend money wisely

**My inspiration for this project**

As an international student who lives alone on campus, I need to go shopping weekly to prepare for the food, necessities,
and anything I needed for the following week. Without a list, I always feel disoriented and overwhelmed by the dazzling 
shelves in the market. Not only do I wasted a lot of time figuring out what I really need, but also wasted my money to 
buy many kinds of stuff that I actually don't need. Sometimes I even repurchased or over purchase something that lead to 
expires in my fridge later. Since my living expenses are limited, I realized the importance to have an organized shopping 
list and keep track of my balance. I can't imagine how helpful it would be for me and hopefully for many other people to 
have a tool that combines these two applications. Therefore, I want to create an intelligent tool that could bring efficiency 
and happiness to life, have a more pleasant shopping experience, and better managing our relationship with money.
